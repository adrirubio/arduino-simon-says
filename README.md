Minimal Simonâ€‘Says game for Arduino: 4 LEDs, 4 buttons
This project recreates the classic Simon Says Game where it tests your memory to remember longer and longer sequences of lights.

## How It Works

The game displays a sequence of lights accompanied by unique tones. Players must repeat the same sequence by pressing the correct pushbutton that corresponds to the led that lit up.

## Components Used

- Arduino Board (Uno R3 in my-build)
- 4 colored LEDs (red, yellow, blue, green)
- 4 pushbuttons
- Resistors and wiring
- 1 piezo buzzer (optional if sound is wanted)

## Repo Structure

- `simon/simon.ino` - Main Arduino code with game logic
- `docs/` - Documentation including wiring diagram and components list
- `my-build` - Build files and demo videos

## Features

- Random pattern generation
- Visual feedback with colored LEDs
- Audio feedback with distinct tones for each color
- Serial monitor output for debugging
