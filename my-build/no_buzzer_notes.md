# No Buzzer Implementation Note

In this build of the Simon Says Game the buzzer was not implemented.

## What do I have to do if I don't want to implement a buzzer?

Nothing, the code works the same with and without the buzzer no changes are needed.

## Any Impact on Gameplay?

Without the buzzer:
- Players rely solely on visual cues from the colored LEDs
- The game experience is quieter, which may be desired
- The core memory challenge remains intact

## Alternative Approaches

If audio feedback is wanted, these options are available:
- Add a piezo buzzer to pin 8 as specified in the original wiring diagram
- Use external speakers or sound modules
